# Csv2iCal

## Synopsis

Csv2iCal Converter is a simple C# application with Regex, that I've written to convert my Academy class schedule
from csv file to iCal, to give possibility to integrate it for ex. with Google Calendar.

## TODO

- Write web interface OR/AND write WPF interface to give possibility to other students, to convert their class schedules. 

## Prerequisites

.Net Framework 3.5

## How to use

Run csv2ical.exe
Application picks up file 4FZI.csv (hardcoded for now) and generates cal.ical (also hardcoded for now until I'll create interface)
